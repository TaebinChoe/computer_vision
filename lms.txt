Hi, all

 

Welcome to the image classification lab. This lab consists of five subproblems.

 

Problem1: Train convolutional neural networks

Problem2: Train convolutional neural netowrks with modern deep learning techniques 

Problem3: Implement modern convolutional architecture

Problem4: Implement vision transformer

Problem5: Design your architecture

 

Advice

Start early (very important). If you're familiar to PyTorch, this lab would be not to difficult. However, the computation cost is not to light!. Even if you complete all implementation in one hour, your experiment will never be completed in a single day.

If you have questions about this lab, please email to ge_kim@seoultech.ac.kr or use Q & A board. The teaching assistant will give advices like an angel. Or ask me after our class. But note that all questions will be accepted only untill 11/15.

 

 

Good luck :)



for test!
